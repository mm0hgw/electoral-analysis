The theory behind this code is data normalisation. Elections, by their
nature are known closed systems, which are known to be so. This means they
have a population mean, which is used to normalise the dataset due to its
insensitivity to ballot stuffing.

The standard deviation used is calculated from the population mean.

Individual turnout totals are calculated for each reporting centre.

These totals have the population mean subtracted, then they are divided by
the standard deviation.

The sample is now measured in units of standard deviations from the population mean,
and can be trivially compared to the model normal distribution.

The chi squared test is used to measure the correspondence of each ballot to
the normal distribution.
